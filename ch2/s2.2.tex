\section{Exercise 2.17}
\begin{quote}
    Define a procedure \texttt{last-pair} that returns the list that contains
    only the last element of a given (nonempty) list:
    \begin{lstlisting}
(last-pair (list 23 72 149 34))
(34)
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{quote}

\section{Exercise 2.18}
\begin{quote}
    Define a procedure reverse that takes a list as argument and returns a list
    of the same elements in reverse order:
    \begin{lstlisting}
(reverse (list 1 4 9 16 25))
(25 16 9 4 1)
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{quote}

Somewhat atypically, this was much easier (for me, at least) to define as an
iterative process than as a recursive process. The iterative process builds the
result up from the end using \texttt{cons}. The only recursive implementation
that I came up with starts from the beginning of the resulting list, so it
needs to traverse the entire list that it already built on every recursive
invocation, which I did using the previously defined \texttt{append} procedure.

\section{Exercise 2.19}
\begin{quote}
    [Long discussion of using \texttt{cc} with multiple lists of coin
    denominations.]

    Define the procedures \texttt{first-denomination},
    \texttt{except-first-denomination} and \texttt{no-more?} in terms of
    primitive operations on list structures. Does the order of the list
    \texttt{coin-values} affect the answer produced by \texttt{cc}? Why or why
    not?
\end{quote}

\lstinputlisting[firstline=20,lastline=27]{ch2/ex2.19.scm}

The order of \texttt{coin-values} does not affect the answer produced. It just
affects the order in which the possible combinations are explored. At each level
of the recursion, there are still a branch in which one coin is excluded and a
branch in which the amount to be matched is decreased by the value of the
current coin. As long as the recursion continues to the full depth in which all
coins have been considered, all possible combinations will be explored and
evaluated.

\section{Exercise 2.20}
\begin{quote}
    \ldots[W]rite a procedure \texttt{same-parity} that takes one or more
    integers and returns a list of all the arguments that have the same
    even-odd parity as the first argument. For example,
    \begin{lstlisting}
(same-parity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
(1 3 5 7)

(same-parity 2 3 4 5 6 7)
(2 4 6)
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{quote}

\lstinputlisting[firstline=3,lastline=19]{ch2/ex2.20.scm}

This produces a recursive process, whereas I'd prefer an iterative one.
However, it allows the resulting list to be built up one element at a time
without traversing to the end to add each element. An iterative process that
considered successive elements of the input list, starting at the head, would
require repeated traversal of the output list to get the elements in the correct
order. This would involve a recursive component and probably more copying of
data.

\section{Exercise 2.21}
\begin{quote}
    The procedure \texttt{square-list} takes a list of numbers as argument and
    returns a list of the squares of those numbers.
    \begin{lstlisting}
(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
(1 4 9 16)
    \end{lstlisting}
    Here are two different definitions of \texttt{square-list}. Complete both
    of them by filling in the missing expressions:
    \begin{lstlisting}
(define (square-list items)
  (if (null? items)
      nil
      (cons <??> <??>)))

(define (square-list items)
  (map <??> <??>))
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{quote}
