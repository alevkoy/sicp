\section{Exercise 2.53}
\begin{quote}
    What would the interpreter print in response to evaluating each of the
    following expressions?
\end{quote}

\begin{lstlisting}
(list 'a 'b 'c)
> (a b c)
(list (list 'george))
> ((george))
(cdr '((x1 x2) (y1 y2)))
> ((y1 y2))
(cadr '((x1 x2) (y1 y2)))
> (y1 y2)
(pair? (car '(a short list)))
> #f
(memq 'red '((red shoes) (blue socks)))
> #f
(memq 'red '(red shoes blue socks))
> #t
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Exercise 2.54}
\begin{quote}
    Two lists are said to be \texttt{equal?} if they contain equal elements
    arranged in the same order. For example,

    \begin{lstlisting}
(equal? '(this is a list)
        '(this is a list))
    \end{lstlisting}

is true, but

    \begin{lstlisting}
(equal? '(this is a list)
        '(this (is a) list))
    \end{lstlisting}

    is false. To be more precise, we can define \texttt{equal?} recursively in
    terms of the basic \texttt{eq?} equality of symbols by saying that
    \texttt{a} and \texttt{b} are \texttt{equal?} if they are both symbols and
    the symbols are \texttt{eq?}, or if they are both lists such that
    \texttt{(car a)} is \texttt{equal?} to \texttt{(car b)} and \texttt{(cdr
    a)} is \texttt{equal?} to \texttt{(cdr b)}. Using this idea, implement
    \texttt{equal?} as a procedure.

\section{Exercise 2.55}
\begin{quote}
    Eva Lu Ator types to the interpreter the expression

    \begin{lstlisting}
(car ''abracadabra)
    \end{lstlisting}

    To her surprise, the interpreter prints back \texttt{quote}. Explain.
\end{quote}

The character \texttt{'} is a syntactic shorthand for using the special form
\texttt{quote} with the following object as the argument. It evaluates to a
list of the symbols in the argument. When it is used on itself, as here, the
inner \texttt{quote} gets evaluated by the outer \texttt{quote}, producing a
list with \texttt{quote} as its first element, i.e.
\begin{lstlisting}
(quote abracadabra)
\end{lstlisting}
\texttt{car} then evaluates to the first element of its argument.

\section{Exercise 2.56}
\begin{quote}
    Show how to extend the basic differentiator to handle more kinds of
    expressions. For instance, implement the differentiation rule
    $$\frac{d(u^n)}{dx} = nu^{n-1}\frac{du}{dx}$$
    by adding a new clause to the \texttt{deriv} program and defining
    appropriate procedures \texttt{exponentiation?}, \texttt{base},
    \texttt{exponent}, and \texttt{make-exponentiation}. (You may use the
    symbol \texttt{**} to denote exponentiation.) Build in the rules that
    anything raised to the power 0 is 1 and anything raised to the power 1 is
    the thing itself.

\section{Exercise 2.57}
\begin{quote}
    Extend the differentiation program to handle sums and products of arbitrary
    numbers of (two or more) terms. Then the last example above could be
    expressed as
    \begin{lstlisting}
(deriv '(* x y (+ x 3)) 'x)
    \end{lstlisting}
    Try to do this by changing only the representation for sums and products,
    without changing the \texttt{deriv} procedure at all. For example, the
    \texttt{addend} of a sum would be the first term, and the \texttt{augend}
    would be the sum of the rest of the terms.
\end{quote}

The new representation of sums and products is a list with the operator in the
first position and the terms in subsequent positions. The only things that needs
to change are the selectors for the second operands:

\section{Exericse 2.58}
\begin{quote}
    Suppose we want to modify the differentiation program so that it works with
    ordinary mathematical notation, in which \texttt{+} and \texttt{*} are
    infix rather than prefix operators. Since the differentiation program is
    defined in terms of abstract data, we can modify it to work with different
    representations of expressions solely by changing the predicates,
    selectors, and constructors that define the representation of the algebraic
    expressions on which the differentiator is to operate.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Show how to do this in order to differentiate algebraic
            expressions presented in infix form, such as \texttt{(x + (3 * (x +
            (y + 2))))}. To simplify the task, assume that \texttt{+} and
            \texttt{*} always take two arguments and that expressions are fully
            parenthesized.
        \item The problem becomes substantially harder if we allow standard
            algebraic notation, such as \texttt{(x + 3 * (x + y + 2))}, which
            drops unnecessary parentheses and assumes that multiplication is
            done before addition. Can you design appropriate predicates,
            selectors, and constructors for this notation such that our
            derivative program still works?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In fully parenthesized infix form, the only things that need to
        change are the constructors and selectors for the different types of
        expressions.
        \lstinputlisting[firstline=147,lastline=200]{ch2/ex2.56.scm}
    \item Using standard algebraic notation, the predicates identifying the
        different types of expressions need to employ a notion of precedence.
        An expression is only of the type indicated by a certain operator if no
        lower-precedence operators are present. The selectors are modified to
        search for the operand relevant to their type and split the overall
        expression around that operator. The constructors stay the same as in
        part 1, which can result in output expressions that are not reduced to
        the simplest form, but that would be considerably more complicated.
