# SICP exercises
Solutions to problems from _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs,
2e_ by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman.

I have run the programs contained herein using
[MIT Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/). I have also made some
use of the very convenient [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages). Not all
programs have been tested on the latter interpreter.

## Building
Some of the solutions are written in LaTeX. To typeset them into PDF, run
`make`. You will need the packages `pdflatex`, `amsmath`, `amsthm`, `color`,
`IEEEtrantools`, `listings`, and `tikz-qtree`.

## Licensing
These solutions incorporate text from [_Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs, 2e_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) by Harold Abelson and
Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman as translated (indirectly) into
[HTML5](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/) by Andres Raba. These works are

Licenses ([CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)).
Consequently, this work is also licensed under a Creative Commons

Specifically, I have quoted the problem statements from _SICP_ (translated into
LaTeX) that correspond to each solution, and I have included in my solutions
some code from _SICP_ necessary for my original code. Where my code mixes with
_SICP_ code, I have indicated which is which.

I am aware that Creative Commons licenses are not ideal for software. However,
given that the software components of these solutions are small, trivial, and
widely reimplemented by numerous other people, I am not overly concerned that
users will be deprived. Publishing these solutions under multiple licenses
sounds complicated and isn't something I want to deal with right now.
